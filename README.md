# Weed-Racer
Modded Chip racer game originally made by Workplace2Software but i modded it :)

# Compiling
To compile the game without ERRORS you need a copy of Gamemaker 8.1 pro and the Caster Gamemaker extension and they DLLS.

# UnmanagedProcess.dll
Because that DLL isn't modded the source code to compile that dll is here: ``https://github.com/Workplace2Software/ChipDesktopBuddy/tree/main/games/racer/UnmanagedProcess``

# SUPERFUCKINGMODS.DLL
That DLL is just a hooker so don't mind about it. ~~That DLL is a lie, check the DLL on a hex editor for more information...~~
